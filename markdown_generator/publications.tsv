2013-10-15	Intellectual freedom takes the bus	BCLA Browser	In October 2013, BCLA wrote a letter to TransLink in support of the Metro Vancouver transit company's decision to run controversial political advertisements on its buses and in a Vancouver SkyTrain station. In this brief article we look at why this was an important intellectual freedom issue for librarians. Though it was not about book banning or other things we traditionally guard against happening within library walls, it is still at the heart of what libraries stand for in our communities.
